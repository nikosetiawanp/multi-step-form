- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

#### ðŸš§ Challenges & Solutions

##### Integrating Zod into React Hook Form

Integrating Zod into React Hook form was tricky, because React Hook Form official docs only shows integration with yup. It took several tries to do it perfectly. Nothing major, could be resolved by reading the docs carefully. For those interested, you can visit [https://nikosetiawanp.hashnode.dev/how-to-integrate-zod-into-react-hook-form](https://nikosetiawanp.hashnode.dev/how-to-integrate-zod-into-react-hook-form) on how I did it.

##### Tailwind Responsive Text

For some reason, Tailwind v4 doesn't let me override a custom class at different breakpoints. Specifically, this doesn't work: `text-preset-5 md:text-preset-4`. Tailwind refuses to apply the `text-preset-4` styles at the md breakpoint and above.

As a workaround, I had to manually apply the styles using something like `md:text-[14px]` to increase the text size on tablet screens.

### Continued development

Currently, no plan for continued development, as this is a one-and-done challenge.
